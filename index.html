          <p>
            JCL Guitar Clinics are an informal musical meet up between you the
            musicians, and us the instructors. We host a medium-sized audience
            mostly bi-monthly, and answer all types of questions relating to
            each of our styles and techniques. We hope by coming along that you
            will improve your own skill sets and your understanding of music and
            composition. We perform entire pieces from our own repertoires, and
            demonstrate techniques for our audiences to observe. The objective
            is for you to learn from us and to have fun and to meet up with
            fellow musicians!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We have quite a line up of instructors here at JCL. Such a line up
            in fact, that it almost seems unbelievable! And in case you're
            wondering - JCL stands for 'Just Come Learn', and it's COMPLETELY
            FREE to attend. Unbelievable! We try to host our clinics at least
            once in every 2 month period but we do not have set dates to give in
            advance. We also like to give everybody a chance to attend one of
            our clinics and like to have a first come first served policy.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            If you think that all of this sounds good to you, then check our
            registration page regularly! The registration will be open 3 days in
            advance of the clinic so don't forget to keep checking as places are
            limited! When you have registered we will contact you with all of
            the info for the upcoming clinic.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>We look forward to meeting you!</p>
