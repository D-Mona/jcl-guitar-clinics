# JCL Guitar Clinics

JCL Guitar Clinics ia a fictional website for musicians(guitar players) who would like to improve their knowledge of music and playing techniques. It caters to musicians of any ability and has open registrations approximately once every two months. Registration is open for 3 days before an event has been organised and registrations are based on a first come first served basis. This is to allow a diverse group of players to get an opportunity to attend a clinic.

Users of the site will find info on the instructors who participate in the clinic and their styles and music, demonstrated by some video content and introductory information. If registrations are available they will be able to register their interest through an application form and subsequently will be contacted with follow up information relating to the event as soon as the organisers have recieved their details.
