# JCL Guitar Clinics

JCL Guitar Clinics ia a fictional website for musicians(guitar players) who would like to improve their knowledge of music and playing technique. It caters to musicians of any ability and has open registrations approximately once every two months. Registration is open for 3 days before an event is to take place and registrations are based on a first come first served basis. This is to allow a diverse group of players to get an opportunity to attend a clinic.

Users of the site will find info on the instructors who participate in the clinic, and their styles of music. This is demonstrated by some video content and introductory information on a section of the site. If registrations are open users will be able to register their interest through an application form. They will subsequently be contacted with follow up information relating to the event as soon as the organisers have recieved their details.

## Design

- I originally drew rough designs on paper and decided due to time restraints that I would keep both the mobile and desktop versions pretty much the same.

- I had an idea of the colour scheme from the start and literally implemented right it at the very end.

- I created quick wireframes that were similar to the original drawings for demonstration purposes here.

- Performance and Accessibility

![Initial Performance](assets/images/original-lighthouse-report.png)
   - Initially I had a poor performance score but after resizing the culprit images and converting to webp my score was improved dramatically.

![Conversion Performance](assets/images/after-conversion-lighthouse-report.png)

- I was losing 6 points on the accessibility on the following image due to contrasting colours, but it was a colour scheme that I liked, and it was crystal clear to me so I chose to leave it.
